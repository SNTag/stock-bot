* Description

A Stock Bot to keep me updated on my investments.  I am a lazy investor; once I make an investment, I don't check up on it often.  But for the stocks that I am taking a gamble on, or to just get an idea of market health, I would like an automated.  It functions through emails.

*NOTE 1* Because of where the config file has to be placed currently, it will only work on linux for now.
*NOTE 2* Only works with Alpha Vantage, I do not plan to configure it otherwise.
*NOTE 3* Does not save status currently.  Everything will reset if script is stopped.
*NOTE 4* User defined trigger conditions cannot be set without modifying the base script file for now.

* To Use

- Register for an [[https://www.alphavantage.co/][Alpha Vantage API key]]
