# Description

A Stock Bot to keep me updated on my investments.  I am a lazy investor; once I make an investment, I don't check up on it often.  But for the stocks that I am taking a gamble on, or to just get an idea of market health, I would like them to give the occasional message.  The system will pull data from Alpha Vantage, check for issues of interest, and send the information to an email as configured in a "bot-login.cnf".

My stock-bot is being reprogrammed in R. This is a work in progress.

# To Use

## Prerequisites

### setting up the fundamentals and notifications

### Setting up data collection

- Register for an [[https://www.alphavantage.co/][Alpha Vantage API key]]
- Add this key to somewhere in your 'bot-login.cnf' as such:

#+BEGIN_SRC
[AV]
apiKey=(YOUR Alpha Vantage API KEY HERE)

[Data]
stock-bot-daily-timeseries=/path/to/daily/timeseries/output/
stock-bot-graphs=/path/to/graph/output/
#+END_SRC

remember to add the backslash AT THE END of the path as well.

### Add stocks of interest

Requires "./input/portfolio-summary.csv" in the following example format:

#+BEGIN_SRC
"var"
"AUY"
"MSFT"
"CVX"
#+END_SRC

"var" being ticker name.

## To Use

To run, modify crontab or similar program to run 'stock-bot.R' at a frequency of your choice.  I will
eventually add a setup file that will rapidly set up the software and crontab.

# Technical details

These details are unnecessary for everyday usage.

## Tracking companies and the investment plan they are under

Using a basic csv sheet, each company and the plan they are under are read. Informing the program what investment plan they are under is important only to the notifications you receive.

The csv sheet should look as such:

| stocks  | investment.plan  |
|---|---|
| TickerA  | planA  |
| TickerB  | planB  |
| TickerC  | planC  |

## keeping record of banned companies

Done using json. Holds a list of stock names as element names, representing a date. The date informs when the stock is to be taken OFF the banned list.

## Notifications

User needs to set up an appropiate notification system. An example notifier using an ITFFF app and webhooks is in 'notify.sh'. Make sure to replace '<your-key>' in notify.sh with your own key.
